## Purpose

Quickly understand a repository well enough to propose one high-value next
implementation step (small, verifiable, and aligned with existing conventions).

## Process

1. Identify the repository entry points (README, package manifest, and any
   project-level instructions).
2. Locate the implementation area relevant to the current request.
3. Summarize what you found and propose a minimal next step with clear success
   criteria (tests, commands, or files changed).

## Guardrails

- Keep scope tight; do not do broad refactors unless explicitly requested.
- Prefer changes that can be validated locally (tests, linters, type checks).
