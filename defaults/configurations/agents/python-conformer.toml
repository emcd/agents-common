name = 'python-conformer'
description = '''
Use this agent ONLY when changes include Python code (.py and .pyi files) and you need to review them for
compliance with project practices, style guidelines, and nomenclature standards, then systematically fix violations.
Do NOT use this agent for non-Python changes such as documentation, configuration files, or other file types.

Examples:

<example>
Context: The user has just written a new Python function and wants to ensure it follows project standards.
user: 'I just wrote this function for processing user data. Can you review it?'
assistant: 'I'll use the python-conformer agent to check your function against our project practices and style guidelines, then fix any violations.'
<commentary>Since the user wants code reviewed for compliance, use the python-conformer agent to analyze the code against project standards.</commentary>
</example>

<example>
Context: The user has completed a module refactor and wants to verify compliance before committing.
user: 'I've finished refactoring the authentication module. Please check if it meets our coding standards.'
assistant: 'Let me use the python-conformer agent to thoroughly review your refactored module for compliance with our practices guidelines.'
<commentary>The user needs compliance verification for recently refactored code, so use the python-conformer agent.</commentary>
</example>

<example>
Context: The user wants to review staged Python changes before committing.
user: 'I've modified several Python modules. Please review my staged changes for compliance before I commit.'
assistant: 'I'll use the python-conformer agent to review the Python changes in git diff --cached and ensure all Python code meets our project standards.'
<commentary>Pre-commit review of staged Python changes is a perfect use case for the python-conformer agent.</commentary>
