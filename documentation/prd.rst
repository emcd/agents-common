Executive Summary
===============================================================================

The emcd-agents-common repository provides centralized, version-controlled 
configurations for AI agent tools including Claude Code, Gemini CLI, and future 
AI development environments. This repository enables rapid iteration on AI agent 
configurations without heavyweight release processes, while maintaining 
consistency across multiple project templates and ensuring clean separation 
between project structure and evolving agent content.

Problem Statement
===============================================================================

Current AI agent configuration management faces several critical issues:

**Heavyweight Configuration Updates**
Users and maintainers must create full stable releases of project templates 
for minor AI agent configuration changes, creating friction for rapid iteration 
on slash commands, subagent definitions, and hook scripts.

**Configuration Drift and Inconsistency** 
Template and production versions of AI agent configurations drift apart, 
requiring manual synchronization that is error-prone and leads to inconsistent 
behavior across projects.

**Distribution Coordination Problems**
Hook configurations reference script paths that must be coordinated between 
distributed configurations and actual script locations, creating complex 
dependencies between repositories.

**Multi-Tool Scaling Challenges**
As additional AI tools (Gemini CLI, Opencode) require similar configuration 
management, the current approach does not scale cleanly across multiple 
AI development environments.

Goals and Objectives
===============================================================================

**Primary Objectives**

* Enable rapid iteration on AI agent configurations without heavyweight release processes
* Eliminate configuration drift between templates and production environments
* Provide single source of truth for all AI agent tooling across multiple projects
* Support clean extensibility for future AI development tools

**Secondary Objectives**

* Simplify distribution workflow through tag-based releases
* Maintain backward compatibility with existing project structures
* Reduce maintenance overhead for configuration synchronization

**Success Metrics**

* Configuration updates deploy within hours rather than requiring full releases
* Zero manual synchronization steps between template and production configurations
* New AI tools integrate without restructuring existing content
* Projects reference consistent, versioned configurations across all environments

Target Users
===============================================================================

**Primary Users: Project Maintainers**
Developers who maintain multiple projects using AI development tools and need 
consistent, up-to-date agent configurations across all projects without manual 
synchronization overhead.

**Secondary Users: AI Tool Contributors**
Contributors who develop slash commands, subagents, and related tooling 
configurations and need rapid feedback cycles for testing and deployment.

**Technical Requirements**
* Familiarity with git tag-based workflows
* Understanding of template-based configuration management
* Experience with AI development tool configuration (Claude Code settings, etc.)

Functional Requirements
===============================================================================

**REQ-001: Data-Driven Repository Structure** (Priority: Critical)
As a project maintainer, I want AI tool configurations organized as structured 
data sources so that I can maintain tool-agnostic sources while generating 
tool-specific outputs.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Repository uses ``data/`` directory with 3-tier separation (configurations/, contents/, templates/)
- TOML configurations provide tool-agnostic metadata with semantic allowed-tools specifications
- Coder-specific content bodies support fallback strategies (Claude â†” Opencode, Gemini isolated)
- Generic Jinja2 templates handle format differences across AI coding tools
- Directory naming follows consistent terminology conventions

**REQ-002: Structured Source Data Management** (Priority: Critical)
As a project maintainer, I want structured source data that generates 
content for multiple AI tools so that I maintain single sources while 
supporting diverse tool formats.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Command and agent metadata stored in tool-agnostic TOML configurations
- Content bodies separated by coder with appropriate fallback strategies
- Generic templates handle format differences across AI coding tools
- Hook scripts distributed via minimal Copier template (not generated)
- Single source of truth drives generation for all supported AI tools

**REQ-003: Hybrid Distribution Architecture** (Priority: High)
As a project maintainer, I want base configuration templates combined with 
dynamic content generation so that I can maintain proven distribution for 
static templates while enabling fast iteration for dynamic content.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Minimal Copier template provides base settings templates and directory structure
- agentsmgr populate command generates tool-specific content from structured sources
- Base templates handle hook path references and MCP server configurations
- Generated content ignored via .gitignore patterns (not committed)
- Configuration detection from Copier answers files or defaults

**REQ-004: Tag-Based Release Distribution** (Priority: High)
As a project maintainer, I want lightweight tag-based releases so that 
I can get configuration updates quickly without waiting for heavyweight 
project releases.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Repository supports agents-N tag versioning scheme
- CLI tooling can pull from specific tagged versions
- Downstream projects can pin to known-good configuration versions
- Publishing workflow automatically deploys tagged releases

**REQ-005: Generated Content Path Compatibility** (Priority: Critical)
As a project maintainer, I want generated content to reference correct paths 
so that distributed configurations work correctly in downstream projects.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Generated commands and agents reference .auxiliary/configuration/ paths for compatibility
- Hook scripts distributed via Copier template function correctly when deployed
- Generated content follows established project deployment patterns
- Template references remain valid after agentsmgr populate generation

**REQ-006: Multi-Tool Content Generation** (Priority: Medium)
As a project maintainer, I want extensible content generation for future AI tools 
so that new tools can be added without restructuring existing data sources.

Acceptance Criteria:
- New AI tools supported by adding coder directories and format templates
- Existing source data (configurations/, contents/) unaffected by new tool additions
- Shared resources (MCP servers, base settings) available via Copier template
- Consistent template patterns for tool-specific format generation

Non-Functional Requirements
===============================================================================

**Performance Requirements**
* Configuration distribution completes within 5 minutes of tag creation
* CLI setup commands execute within 30 seconds for typical project sizes
* Repository size remains manageable (< 100MB) for rapid cloning

**Reliability Requirements**
* Tag-based distribution provides atomic, consistent configuration deployment
* Rollback capability to previous configuration versions through tag references
* Graceful handling of missing or malformed configuration files

**Compatibility Requirements**
* Support existing Claude Code settings.json format and expectations
* Maintain compatibility with Copier template generation workflows
* Work with standard git workflow practices and CI/CD pipelines

**Usability Requirements**
* Clear, intuitive directory structure for locating configurations
* Self-documenting configuration templates with appropriate comments
* Minimal learning curve for maintainers familiar with existing workflows

Constraints and Assumptions
===============================================================================

**Technical Constraints**
* Must work within git-based workflow and standard GitHub Actions
* Configuration templates must be compatible with Jinja2 templating engine
* Hook scripts must execute in standard shell environments

**Dependencies**
* Relies on continued availability of target AI tools (Claude Code, Gemini CLI)
* Depends on stable MCP server interfaces for cross-tool functionality
* Requires coordination with python-project-common template updates

**Assumptions**
* Users have git and standard development tools available
