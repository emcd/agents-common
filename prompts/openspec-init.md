Please read `documentation/architecture/openspec/project.md` and help me fill
it out with details about my project, tech stack, and conventions.

When documenting project conventions, please reference relevant architectural
documentation:
- If this project has `documentation/architecture/filesystem.rst`, reference it
  in the "Project Conventions" section under an appropriate subsection (e.g.,
  "Filesystem Organization").
- Include references to any other key architectural documentation files.

Do not refer to the project or package name directly, so that the document will
be more maintainable if it the project is renamed or if the document is copied
for reuse elsewhere.
