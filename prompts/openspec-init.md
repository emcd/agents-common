Please read openspec/project.md and help me fill it out with details about my project, tech stack, and conventions.

When documenting project conventions, please reference relevant architectural documentation:
- If this project has documentation/architecture/filesystem.rst, reference it in the "Project Conventions" section under an appropriate subsection (e.g., "Filesystem Organization")
- Include references to any other key architectural documentation files
