# Known Issues

## Missing Codex Content

**Date Identified:** 2025-10-23

**Description:** When running `agentsmgr populate ./defaults .`, the command fails with error:

```
‚ùå No commands content found for codex: cs-develop-pytests
```

**Context:**
- Codex is configured as one of the coders in `.auxiliary/configuration/copier-answers--agents.yaml`
- Content appears to be missing for at least the `cs-develop-pytests` command
- This is blocking full population runs (only works with `--mode nowhere`)

**Investigation Needed:**
- Check if Codex content files exist in `defaults/contents/commands/codex/`
- Verify if this is an incomplete implementation or missing data files
- Determine if Codex support should be fully implemented or removed from default coders list

**Workaround:** Use `--mode nowhere` to skip content generation when testing other features
